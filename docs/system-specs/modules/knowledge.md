# Knowledge Module

## Overview

The Knowledge Library is KiroCrew's personal knowledge graph: a local, SQLite-backed corpus that ingests documents (folders, uploads, artifacts, fetched URLs), chunks and entity-extracts them via a bounded LLM worker pool, and serves hybrid retrieval (FTS5 keyword + graph traversal + optional vector) to the LLM through the `local_knowledge_search` MCP tool. All ingestion and search stay on-host; the only external calls are the extraction/URL-fetch worker's ACP LLM turns and the local Ollama embedding endpoint.

```

## 1. FileReader & supported formats (`readers.py`)

`FileReader.read(path)` returns `(text, meta)`. It first refuses sensitive paths — `is_sensitive_path(path)` raises `PermissionError("Refusing to read sensitive path: …")` before any open — then dispatches by lower-cased extension.

`FileReader.SUPPORTED` (`readers.py`) is the ingestion allowlist:

```
'', '.md', '.txt', '.org', '.py', '.java', '.ts', '.js', '.rs', '.go',
'.html', '.htm', '.docx', '.pdf',
'.csv', '.log', '.json', '.yaml', '.yml', '.sh', '.rb', '.c', '.cpp', '.h'
```

It includes markdown/plain-text (`.md`/`.txt`/`.org`), source-code extensions, and the two binary formats with declared optional deps (`.pdf` → pdfplumber, `.docx` → python-docx).

**Dispatch (`_DISPATCH`, `readers.py`)** routes only `.pdf`/`.pptx`/`.docx`/`.html`/`.htm` to specialized readers. Anything else — including `.org`, `.txt`, `.md`, and every source-code extension — falls through to the generic `_read_text` path (UTF-8 with a latin-1 fallback) and into the generic chunker downstream. So `.org` is treated as plain text; there is no Org-mode-specific parser.

**`.pptx` is intentionally out of `SUPPORTED`** even though `_read_pptx` exists: python-pptx is not declared in `setup.cfg`, so the format is kept off the allowlist (the comment at `readers.py` documents this). Reachable only if `.pptx` were re-added to `SUPPORTED`.

**Binary/optional-dep readers** degrade gracefully — a missing optional import returns an `{'format': 'error'}` meta with an install hint rather than raising:
- `_read_pdf` — pdfplumber; concatenates per-page `extract_text()`, records `page_count`.
- `_read_docx` — python-docx; converts `Heading N` paragraph styles to `#`-prefixed markdown (`content_type: 'markdown'`), records `paragraph_count`.
- `_read_html` — html2text when importable (`ignore_images=True`, `ignore_links=False`); otherwise a regex fallback strips `<script>`/`<style>` and tags.

Base metadata always carries `format`, `title` (file stem), `file_size`, `extension`, and a computed `line_count`.

## 2. Folder discovery & scan (`folder_watcher.py`)

**Namespace routing**: folder/vault sources read their target namespace from `properties["namespace"]` (default `"default"`). The `add_source` handler accepts namespace either as a top-level body field or inside `properties`; a top-level `namespace` is folded into `properties` (if dict and not already set) before storage. This ensures FolderWatcher and Watcher resolve the correct namespace at scan time via `props.get("namespace", "default")`.
`FolderWatcher.scan_source(source)` scans a folder-type source under a per-`source_id` `asyncio.Lock` (one scan per source at a time) and returns `{new, changed, deleted, skipped, capped, failed}`.

**`_walk(root, ignore_patterns, extra_skip_dirs)`** (run via `asyncio.to_thread`) is the discovery step:
- Prunes `HARD_SKIP_DIRS`, any per-source-type extra skip dirs (`SOURCE_TYPE_SKIP_DIRS["obsidian_vault"] = {.obsidian, .trash}`), and **all** dotfiles/dot-dirs in place during `os.walk`.
- Skips OS junk/lock files by case-insensitive basename match against `DEFAULT_IGNORE_GLOBS` (macOS AppleDouble `._*`, `.ds_store`, Office `~$*`, LibreOffice `.~lock.*`, `thumbs.db`, `desktop.ini`, `*.tmp`, editor swap/backup, partial downloads). This exists because a discovered-but-unreadable file that carries a supported extension fails ingestion, is never auto-retried, and would otherwise leave a source permanently stalled below 100%.
- Applies the source's `ignore_patterns` (fnmatch against the relative path).
- **Extension filter**: keeps a file only if its lower-cased suffix is in `FileReader.SUPPORTED` **or** equals `.canvas` (Obsidian canvas files).
- **Sensitive-path guard**: resolves each candidate (`Path.resolve()`) and skips it if `is_sensitive_path()` matches.
- Returns `[(full_path, mtime)]`.

**Scan bookkeeping (`_do_scan`)**:
- Discovered files above `props["max_files"]` (default `DEFAULT_MAX_FILES` = 5000) are capped **newest-first** (sort by mtime desc); the surplus count is reported as `capped`.
- Deletion detection uses the **full** discovered set (pre-cap) so capping never triggers false deletions; a vanished file's items are archived via `_handle_deleted` → `store.delete_items_batch`.
- Change detection is mtime-then-content-hash: unchanged mtime → `last_seen` bump only; changed mtime but identical SHA-256 → state refresh, no re-ingest.
- Per-file state lives in the `folder_file_state` table with `status` ∈ `{done, scanning, skipped, failed, deduped}`. `scanning` is written **before** ingest so a crash mid-file is recoverable; `skipped`/`failed`/`deduped` files are not auto-retried (user must retry).
- **TOCTOU defense**: `_ingest_file` re-resolves symlinks and re-checks `is_sensitive_path` at ingest time; a block writes `status='failed'` and emits an SEL `knowledge.source.file.ingest_denied` (`outcome="denied"`, `reason=sensitive_path_toctou`) audit event.
- After a successful scan, each newly ingested/changed file gets a **targeted** cross-source dedup (`dedup_document(..., apply=True)`) — O(k·n) over the k changed files rather than a full O(n²) corpus sweep — so a folder copy collapses any matching one-shot upload.
- **Aggregate sources are not dedup units.** Sources in `_AGGREGATE_SOURCE_TYPES` (currently `artifact` — one source holding many independent documents) are excluded from dedup at every layer: `enumerate_docs` skips them, `_build_doc_for` returns `None` for whole-source builds, and `_delete_doc` refuses a cascade delete on them. A whole-aggregate DocRef keyed on one item's `content_hash` misrepresents the collection, and losing a dedup pair used to cascade-delete the entire artifact library. Per-artifact-slug dedup is future work; until then artifact↔folder overlap is intentionally left in place.

## 3. LLMPool workers (`llm_pool.py`)

Both entity extraction (`EntityExtractor`) and internal-URL fetch (`agent_fetch.fetch_url_content`) acquire workers from a shared `LLMPool` — a provider-agnostic, bounded pool (`DEFAULT_POOL_SIZE` = 3) of **long-lived** ACP workers. A `Worker` ABC has two concrete paths:

- **Default (kiro-cli)** — `AcpWorker` drives the `kirocrew-knowledge` agent over ACP (`AGENT_NAME`). That agent is installed by `agent.py:_install_knowledge_agent` (model `claude-haiku-4.5`, kirocrew-core tools only — no internal MCP wiring in the OSS fork).
- **`agent.provider="claude_code"`** — `CCWorker` drives a long-lived `claude` CLI subprocess over stream-json I/O (haiku model, `bypassPermissions`); URL-fetch tools are opt-in via `KIROCREW_KNOWLEDGE_FETCH_TOOLS`. This fork's provider enum accepts `claude_code`, so this branch is live, not dormant — see [providers](providers.md).

**Response shape (`CCWorker._collect_response`).** The terminal `result` event carries the final text as a **string**, not a content-block dict, and it repeats what already streamed as `assistant` text blocks. So the streamed blocks are authoritative and `result` is a fallback used only when nothing streamed — appending both would hand the extractor's `json.loads` two concatenated objects. `thinking` blocks are never collected, for the same parse reason. Reading `result` as a dict raised `'str' object has no attribute 'get'` on **every** message; because `LLMPool.send_batch` catches per item and `EntityExtractor.extract_batch` swallows the batch, the failure was silent — ingestion reported `completed`, every item stored with a heading-derived title and a NULL summary, and the entity graph stayed permanently empty. Any change here needs a test against the real event shape, not a hand-written fixture.

### Sweep shielding + audit source

`AcpWorker.start()` wires two protections that matter for a long-lived pool worker (`llm_pool.py`):

- **Sweep shielding via `register_protected_pid`** — pool workers are direct `AcpClient` sessions, **not** `SessionMap` sessions or warm-pool providers, so the gateway's periodic orphan sweep cannot see them via `_collect_active_pids` and would SIGKILL a *busy* worker mid-task (surfacing as `ACP process exited (code=1)`). After `ensure_ready()`, `AcpWorker` registers the worker's kiro-cli PID in the sweep-protected set via `register_protected_pid` (`session_pid.py`), and unregisters it in `shutdown()` and on respawn — so the orphan sweep treats it like a live session (the same `register_protected_pid` mechanism the shared `WorkerPool` engine in `acp/worker_pool.py` applies to `ReviewPool`'s `AcpReviewWorker`).
- **`audit_source="subagent"`** — pool workers run tools without passing through `chat_runner` or `SubagentManager`, so their tool calls would otherwise never reach the security audit log. With `audit_source` set, `AcpClient` emits an SEL `log_tool_invocation` record (`source="subagent"`, `outcome="auto_approved"`) per auto-approved tool call; the emit is offloaded to `subprocess_executor()` and bounded by `asyncio.wait_for` so a hung SEL backend never stalls tool dispatch. `None` (chat/subagent clients) never double-logs.

### Sandbox parity

`_get_sandbox_mode()` reads `agent.sandbox` (default `"off"` → defers isolation to kiro-cli's internal agent sandbox; set `"auto"` for standard OS-level confinement). It distinguishes two fallback cases so a config error can never silently disable sandboxing: an **absent** value defaults to `"off"` (the intended default), while a **present but unrecognised** value falls back to `"auto"` (fail-secure) rather than reaching `wrap_argv` as an unknown mode. Knowledge workers honour the same `agent.sandbox` setting as chat/Slack providers (parity), so the default flows through here too.

### Pool mechanics

`LLMPool.start()` reads config once off the event loop and spawns all workers; `acquire()` blocks on a semaphore when all workers are busy and transparently replaces a dead worker (`is_alive()` false) on acquire. `send()` is the acquire→send→release convenience; `send_batch()` runs prompts concurrently bounded by pool size. A failed spawn during `start()` tears down all already-started workers.

**Untrusted-chunk delimiters (CWE-94).** `EntityExtractor` wraps each untrusted chunk in **per-request nonce-suffixed** delimiters (`<<<BEGIN_UNTRUSTED_CHUNK_{nonce}>>>` / `<<<END_UNTRUSTED_CHUNK_{nonce}>>>`, `nonce = uuid4().hex`), so content that embeds a legacy static delimiter cannot forge the boundary and inject instructions. Both `extract` (single) and `extract_batch` (the ingestion path) apply this, and the batch path mints a **distinct nonce per chunk**.

## 4. FTS5 + graph + vector retrieval (`retrieval.py`, `store.py`)

`HybridRetriever.search(query, limit)` runs three legs and fuses them with Reciprocal Rank Fusion.

**Store (`KnowledgeStore`, `store.py`)** — SQLite (prefers `pysqlite3`, falls back to stdlib `sqlite3`), WAL journal, `foreign_keys=ON`. Items live in `items` (with an `embedding BLOB` and `status`), keyword search is served by the FTS5 virtual table `items_fts(title, content, tags, content=items, content_rowid=rowid)`, and the entity graph is an in-memory `SimpleDiGraph` (a minimal networkx-free replacement). The store keeps `items_fts` in sync on every insert/update/delete of the FTS-backed columns.

- **Keyword leg (`_keyword_search`)** — FTS5 `MATCH` over `items_fts`, ordered by `rank`. `_sanitize_fts5_query` double-quotes each token (doubling internal quotes) so user input never contributes FTS5 operators (parameterized quoting), drops `_STOPWORDS`, and OR-joins the remainder so a natural-language query no longer requires every literal token to match. An all-stopword query falls back to the raw tokens rather than dropping the leg.
- **Graph leg (`_graph_search`)** — resolves query words and adjacent word-pairs to entities, expands via graph neighbors (depth 2), and ranks items by mention count.
- **Vector leg (`_vector_search`)** — brute-force cosine over `items` with `embedding IS NOT NULL AND status='active'`; returns `None` when no embedder is wired. Items whose stored embedding dimension differs from the query vector are **skipped** (not scored 0.0), with a single per-search WARNING so a model swap / stale index surfaces as "re-index needed". `_cosine_similarity` returns 0.0 for differing-length or zero vectors.
- **RRF fusion (`_rrf_fuse`, k=60)** — per-leg weights align positionally with `(keyword, graph, vector) = (1.0, 1.0, VECTOR_RRF_WEIGHT=2.0)` so semantically-strong matches dominate when the keyword leg returns literal junk. Results are tie-broken by recency (`updated_at`), and each result's `match_type` records which legs it appeared in (`keyword+graph+vector`).

**Citation enrichment** — `_attach_source_locations` batch-fetches `source_locations` (adds `section_title`, `chunk_range`, `anchor`); `_attach_citation_sources` adds `source_type`/`source_name`/`source_uri` plus the most specific per-document locator: `file_path` for folder/vault sources (from `folder_file_state`), `artifact_slug`/`artifact_name` for the aggregate artifact source (deep-links `/artifacts/<slug>`). Missing/unmapped sources degrade cleanly (extra keys simply absent).

### `local_knowledge_search` MCP tool (`mcp_core.py`)

The LLM reaches retrieval through the `kirocrew-core` MCP tool `local_knowledge_search`:
- DB path: `config_dir()/workspace/knowledge/knowledge.db`; a missing DB returns "Knowledge Library is not configured…" (SEL `not_configured`).
- `_get_knowledge_search` caches the `(KnowledgeStore, embedder)` pair across calls and rebuilds only when the knowledge DB (or its `-wal`) or `config.json` changes — avoiding the per-call schema DDL / migrate / graph-load and the Ollama availability probe.
- Default `limit` is 3; results below `min_score = 0.012` are dropped. Output is run through `redact_exfiltration_urls()` + `redact_credentials()` before returning, and every call emits an SEL audit event (`success` / `no_results` / `not_configured`). Input is validated against `LOCAL_KNOWLEDGE_SEARCH_SCHEMA` (`validation.py`).
- **The response is written through a private stdout descriptor, not fd 1.** The first search's availability probe (`InProcessEmbedder.is_available` → `embed`) kicks the background GGUF load, and the vendored llama-cpp wraps that load in `suppress_stdout_stderr`, which `dup2`s **fd 1 process-wide to `/dev/null`** for the duration (~0.7s) *and* rebinds the `sys.stdout` object. Because the probe returns `None` immediately, the search answers keyword-only in milliseconds — so its JSON-RPC response raced that window and was silently destroyed: no exception, no short write, SEL still logging `success`, and the client hanging until the ACP tool-stall watchdog (`acp/client.py::_TOOL_STALL_TIMEOUT`, 600s) killed the turn. `mcp_shared.run_mcp_stdio_loop` now takes an `os.dup(1)` snapshot (`snapshot_stdout_fd`) at server startup before any tool can run, and `respond()` writes through it under a lock, so responses (and `ping` / `tools/list` replies, which were equally exposed) always reach the client. Falls back to `sys.stdout` when stdout is not fd-backed. Note that "has `sys.stdout` been swapped?" is *not* a usable guard — the suppressor swaps the object too, so it reads as swapped exactly inside the window that must be survived.

The dashboard Knowledge tab uses the same store via a lazily-initialized `KnowledgeStore` on `DashboardState` (`dashboard/state.py`).

## 5. Source-scoped list API (`dashboard/handlers/knowledge.py`)

The dashboard Knowledge list view is **source-first**: it renders one collapsed
row per source and pages *within* a source, rather than paging all items globally
and grouping whatever landed on the page. Two pieces of API surface support this.

### `GET /api/knowledge/items?source_id=<id>`

Scopes the page to a single source. Composes with the existing `type`, `status`,
`namespace`, `q`, `page`, and `limit` params.

- The reported `total` is **scoped to that source**, not the global count. The
  in-group pager derives its page count from it, so a global total would break
  the pager math.
- `source_id=__none__` selects items with no source (`source_id` NULL or empty).
- Applied in both branches of `list_items`: as a SQL predicate in the list
  branch, and via `_matches_source` after ranking in the hybrid-search branch.
- Because the hybrid-search branch filters *after* the retriever has ranked
  globally, a scoped search escalates its candidate pool
  (`_search_until_exhausted`: `_SCOPED_SEARCH_START` doubling to
  `_SCOPED_SEARCH_MAX`) until the retriever short-reads, so the scoped total is
  exact rather than truncated by a fixed window. At the cap the total may
  understate; pushing `source_id` into `HybridRetriever` is the tracked
  follow-up. Unscoped searches keep the cheap `limit * 3` window.

### `GET /api/knowledge/source-counts`

Returns the item count per source **under the active filters**:

```json
{ "counts": { "<source_id>": 42, "__none__": 3 }, "total": 45 }
```

- Accepts `type`, `status`, and `namespace`; the counts reflect them, which is
  why the list view uses this rather than `/sources.item_count` (a source's
  unfiltered, all-namespace total that would over-report when filtered).
- Sourceless items are reported under the `__none__` key.
- The list view derives its rows from these counts, which is what guarantees
  every source is visible at once regardless of relative size.

## Invariants

- **Sensitive paths never ingested** — `FileReader.read`, `FolderWatcher._walk`, `_hash_file`, and `_ingest_file` all gate on `is_sensitive_path()` (with symlink re-resolution at ingest time for TOCTOU).
- **`.org` and unknown-but-supported extensions are plain text** — only `_DISPATCH` extensions get specialized readers; everything else in `SUPPORTED` flows through `_read_text` → generic chunker.
- **Pool workers are long-lived and must be sweep-shielded** — any direct `AcpClient` worker that outlives a chat turn (not tracked in `SessionMap`/warm pool) must register its PID via `register_protected_pid`, or the orphan sweep will kill it mid-task.
- **LLM-derived text is redacted before storage and before return** — ingestion redacts extracted text (`ingestion._redact`), and `local_knowledge_search` redacts its assembled output.
- **FTS query input is parameterized** — user query tokens are always double-quoted literals; the user never injects FTS5 operators.
- **Embedding-dimension mismatches are skipped, not scored** — vector search excludes incomparable-dimension items so a model swap cannot fill the top-K with all-zero ghosts.
- **The self-heal rebuild path never touches SQLite on the event loop** — `_maybe_reembed_stale`'s stale COUNT, `rebuild_embeddings`' total COUNT / page SELECTs / batch progress commits, and the success-path job finalize all run via `asyncio.to_thread` (`store.db` is a per-thread connection, so each worker thread uses its own connection to the same WAL db). On a large KB (observed: ~1.3GB after an embedder-sig change) an inline COUNT can stall past the 25s loop-watchdog threshold and crash-loop the gateway. The one deliberate exception is the CancelledError finalize in `_run_reembed_job`, which stays inline so cancellation cannot pre-empt the single-flight finalize. When the stale count exceeds `_LARGE_REBUILD_WARN_THRESHOLD` the watcher logs a prominent WARNING before starting the full re-embed.
- **`__none__` is a shared wire contract** — the no-source sentinel is defined as `_NO_SOURCE` in `dashboard/handlers/knowledge.py` and mirrored as `NO_SOURCE` in `website/src/pages/knowledge/SourceGroup.tsx`. Both sides must change together; it is effectively un-renameable once shipped.
- **A source-scoped `total` is scoped, never global** — `/items?source_id=` reports the count for that source alone, because the per-source pager computes its page count from it.
- **Per-source badge counts are filter-aware** — list-view badges come from `/source-counts` (which honours `type`/`status`/`namespace`), not from `/sources.item_count`, so a badge never disagrees with the group's contents under a filter.
- **The search branch's candidate load runs off the event loop** — a scoped search escalates its candidate pool, so `_load_items_by_id` (batch `SELECT` plus per-row serialization) and the `source_counts` aggregate both run via `asyncio.to_thread`. `store.db` is a per-thread connection, so each worker thread uses its own. Run inline, either can stall the loop past the watchdog threshold on a large KB.
- **Frontend selection is bounded to on-screen items** — in source-first mode item data lives in per-`SourceGroup` caches, so bulk actions read the items each expanded group reports as rendered, and selected IDs are pruned when a group collapses or pages away. Reading the react-query cache directly would let a bulk Delete reach a retained cache for a source the user can no longer see.
- **Per-source caches are keyed under the `knowledge-items` prefix** — `['knowledge-items', 'source-items', ...]` and `['knowledge-items', 'source-counts', ...]` so every existing `invalidateQueries(['knowledge-items'])` call site reaches them. Consequently any `setQueriesData` on that prefix must guard on the payload shape, since the counts entry has no `items` array.

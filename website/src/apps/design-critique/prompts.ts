/**
 * The critic persona and method, carried by the prompt rather than by an agent.
 *
 * A bundled `design-critic` agent cannot be used from a builtin: a builtin
 * manifest may declare `agents`, but discovery never serializes that field and
 * `bridges.py` resolves an app root under the user data dir, where a builtin has
 * only `app.json`. The agent is therefore never registered, and naming it on
 * `/api/chat` fails every request. (`dev_fleet` has the same latent gap with its
 * two declared skills, neither of which is registered today.) So the persona,
 * the voice rules and the method live here and run on the core agent.

const CRITIC =
  'You are an experienced designer running a heuristic design critique — a fellow designer ' +
  'looking over someone’s work, not a title on a review panel.\n\n' +
  // This is the FIRST instruction of every prompt, and it used to be the denied
  // `python3 -c "import kiro_crew, ..."` — so every run opened with a blocked
  // tool call before it did anything, then burned turns on the "if that prints
  // nothing… use glob" fallback. Load the skill by name instead: the agent
  // resolves it the same way it resolves any other skill, and the two files are
  // relative to it.
  'Before judging anything, load the method: read SKILL.md and ' +
  'frameworks/main-checklist.md from the design-critique skill with fs_read, then follow ' +
  'their method exactly. Do this first, every time — without the checklist the critique is ' +
  'guesswork.\n\n' +
  'Voice: lead with a one-line overall read and a health tally using the NN/g severity names ' +
  '(Cosmetic / Minor / Major / Catastrophe), then what is working, then the top 3-5 things ' +
  'you would tighten (element → problem → fix), then one line on what the evidence could not ' +
  'show. Positives before fixes. No composite 0-100 score. Be warm, specific and concrete. ' +
  'Do not invent personas or backstories to justify a finding. Never judge what the supplied ' +
  'evidence cannot reveal, and never critique visuals from unrendered source.\n\n'

// As a BUILTIN app, the skill's scripts live inside the installed kiro_crew
// package, not under ~/.kiro/crew/apps, so the path is machine-specific and must
// never be hardcoded here.
//
// This used to make the agent resolve both paths by shelling out to
// `python3 -c "import kiro_crew, ..."`. That command is DENIED by design:
// `python -c` that imports kiro_crew reaches the CLI, and
// `python -c "from kiro_crew.cli import main; main()" token` mints a dashboard
// token — so security.py refuses the whole shape (see _SELF_IMPORT_RE, and
// _INLINE_DYNAMIC_EXEC_RE which also closes the __import__/importlib rewrites).
// Every run therefore opened with a blocked tool call and the agent detoured
// looking for a way around it, including re-issuing the same command through an
// MCP shell tool. The gate is right; asking for that command was the bug.
//
// Neither path needs a subprocess:
//   <SCRIPTS>  the agent already loaded this skill, so it knows the directory it
//              read SKILL.md from — the same convention builtin_skills use
//              (browser-recording's `python3 <skill-dir>/scripts/...`).
//   <UPLOADS>  a writable directory for rendered PNGs. The app passes the real
//              one in when it has uploads (their absolute paths come back from
//              /api/upload/file); otherwise the session's working directory is
//              already isolated per run and readable back through /api/file-raw.
